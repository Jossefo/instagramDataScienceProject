# instagramDataScienceProject
Data-Science Project , Crawling data , Cleaning data , Visualization and ML model 

IDEs : 
Pycharm community .
Jupyter Notebook.

Modules uses :
pandas , selenium , instascrape , colorgram , PIL(python imaging library) , sklearn , numpy , time , matplotlib and seaborn


Purpose:
Analyzing instagram posts data - likes , followers , comments and the most dominant colors in the photo.

Questions for ML:
1) Does colors have an effect on instagram post behaviour ( Likes , Engagement etc)  ?
2) Can we predict the amount of the next posts likes by knowing the dominant colors and the amount of followers  ?

Acquisition:
1) Crawling data from instagram posts using Selenium & Instascrape. 
2) Clustering RGB tuples from string (r,g,b) - to numbers between 0-9 . With Kmeans algorithm.
3) duplicates and null handeling.

Visualization and ML:
1) Visualizing data for deeper understanding.
2) Correlation examination.
3) Fitting Linear Model and predicting the Likes.
4) understanding the number and deeper error examinations.
